## About

### Description and Purpose

TaskMate AI is a smart productivity and scheduling web app that helps students stay on top of classes, emails, and personal tasks, all in one place. The app connects to Canvas, Gmail, and Google Calendar via Composio to automatically gather assignments and events, then uses AI to organize and prioritize them.  

Itâ€™s designed for students juggling academics, part-time jobs, and extracurriculars, offering an intelligent dashboard that learns from user habits and adapts over time.

### Inspiration

As a full-time student, balancing deadlines from multiple classes and keeping track of meetings or counselor appointments can be overwhelming. I wanted to build an app that eliminates the mental load of remembering every due date or email reminder.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind  

Backend: Express, PostgreSQL, Render, Composio
